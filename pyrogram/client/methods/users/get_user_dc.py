        .. note::

            This information is approximate: it is based on where Telegram stores a user profile pictures and does not
            by any means tell you the user location (i.e. a user might travel far away, but will still connect to its
            assigned DC). More info at `FAQs <../faq#what-are-the-ip-addresses-of-telegram-data-centers>`_.

        Parameters:
            user_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

        Returns:
            ``int`` | ``None``: The DC identifier as integer, or None in case it wasn't possible to get it (i.e. the
            user has no profile picture or has the privacy setting enabled).

        Raises:
            RPCError: In case of a Telegram RPC error.
