        """Send audio files.

        For sending voice messages, use the :obj:`send_voice()` method instead.

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

            audio (``str``):
                Audio file to send.
                Pass a file_id as string to send an audio file that exists on the Telegram servers,
                pass an HTTP URL as a string for Telegram to get an audio file from the Internet, or
                pass a file path as string to upload a new audio file that exists on your local machine.

            caption (``str``, *optional*):
                Audio caption, 0-1024 characters.

            parse_mode (``str``, *optional*):
                By default, texts are parsed using both Markdown and HTML styles.
                You can combine both syntaxes together.
                Pass "markdown" to enable Markdown-style parsing only.
                Pass "html" to enable HTML-style parsing only.
                Pass None to completely disable style parsing.

            duration (``int``, *optional*):
                Duration of the audio in seconds.

            performer (``str``, *optional*):
                Performer.

            title (``str``, *optional*):
                Track name.

            thumb (``str``, *optional*):
                Thumbnail of the music file album cover.
                The thumbnail should be in JPEG format and less than 200 KB in size.
                A thumbnail's width and height should not exceed 320 pixels.
                Thumbnails can't be reused and can be only uploaded as a new file.

            disable_notification (``bool``, *optional*):
                Sends the message silently.
                Users will receive a notification with no sound.

            reply_to_message_id (``int``, *optional*):
                If the message is a reply, ID of the original message.

            reply_markup (:obj:`InlineKeyboardMarkup` | :obj:`ReplyKeyboardMarkup` | :obj:`ReplyKeyboardRemove` | :obj:`ForceReply`, *optional*):
                Additional interface options. An object for an inline keyboard, custom reply keyboard,
                instructions to remove reply keyboard or to force a reply from the user.

            progress (``callable``, *optional*):
                Pass a callback function to view the upload progress.
                The function must take *(client, current, total, \*args)* as positional arguments (look at the section
                below for a detailed description).

            progress_args (``tuple``, *optional*):
                Extra custom arguments for the progress callback function. Useful, for example, if you want to pass
                a chat_id and a message_id in order to edit a message with the updated progress.

        Other Parameters:
            client (:obj:`Client`):
                The Client itself, useful when you want to call other API methods inside the callback function.

            current (``int``):
                The amount of bytes uploaded so far.

            total (``int``):
                The size of the file.

            *args (``tuple``, *optional*):
                Extra custom arguments as defined in the *progress_args* parameter.
                You can either keep *\*args* or add every single extra argument in your function signature.

        Returns:
            :obj:`Message` | ``None``: On success, the sent audio message is returned, otherwise, in case the upload
            is deliberately stopped with :meth:`~Client.stop_transmission`, None is returned.

        Raises:
            RPCError: In case of a Telegram RPC error.
